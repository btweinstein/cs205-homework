>>Compare performance with 4 and with 1 thread (i.e., serial performance), and
discuss the reasons for any performance difference.

With one thread, we get roughly 12 fps. With 4 threads, we get roughly
16 fps. This is a very small speedup; we naively expect that N cores
should speed us up N times. The overhead must be gigantic here.
