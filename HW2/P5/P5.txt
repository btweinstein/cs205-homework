>>Compare performance with 4 and with 1 thread (i.e., serial performance), and
discuss the reasons for any performance difference.

With one thread, we get roughly 12 fps. With 4 threads, we get roughly
16 fps. This is a very small speedup; we naively expect that N cores
should speed us up N times. The overhead must be gigantic here; we are likely doing expensive operations
at inappropriate times as we have not implemented locks. Qualitatively, the behavior of the simulation
still looks correct, however.

>>Spatial Decomposition

Spatial decomposition *dramatically* increases the FPS of our simulation. With one thread, we get
about 700 fps, while with four threads we find something like 800-900fps. Adding additional threads
does not seem to have a gigantic impact, surprisingly. It is not surprising that we see large
speedups here, as our algorithm changed from O(N^2) to O(N) when N=10^4.
