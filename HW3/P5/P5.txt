These were all tested on my GTX titan black GPU.

# Part 1

## Maze 1
Finished after 915 iterations, 28.839424 ms total, 0.0315184961749 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions


## Maze 2
Finished after 532 iterations, 16.097408 ms total, 0.0302582857143 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

# Part 2

## Maze 1
Finished after 529 iterations, 16.9664 ms total, 0.0320725897921 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions

## Maze 2
Finished after 274 iterations, 8.630432 ms total, 0.0314979270073 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

It looks like the number of iterations was basically cut in half. This makes sense;
if you look up your grandparents label, information can propagate at a rate of
two pixels per iteration as opposed to one. This should halve the number
of iterations.

# Part 3

## Maze 1
Finished after 10 iterations, 0.386208 ms total, 0.0386208 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions

## Maze 2
Finished after 9 iterations, 0.349952 ms total, 0.0388835555556 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

# Part 4

## Maze 1
Finished after 10 iterations, 1.091232 ms total, 0.1091232 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions

## Maze 2

Finished after 9 iterations, 0.983008 ms total, 0.109223111111 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

The number of iterations varies here as well.

# Part 5

It still definitely works. It takes a couple more iterations, as the labels can increase and can be
overwritten while updating, but it converges to the correct answer. For example,

## Maze 1
Finished after 11 iterations, 1.244192 ms total, 0.113108363636 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions

## Maze 2
Finished after 10 iterations, 1.113504 ms total, 0.1113504 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

The number of iterations varies as well, somewhere between 8 and 12.
