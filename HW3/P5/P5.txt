These were all tested on my GTX titan black GPU.

# Part 1

## Maze 1
Finished after 915 iterations, 28.839424 ms total, 0.0315184961749 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions


## Maze 2
Finished after 532 iterations, 16.097408 ms total, 0.0302582857143 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

# Part 2

#TODO: Recheck part 2 on GPU

## Maze 1
Finished after 529 iterations, 22.62528 ms total, 0.042769905482 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions

## Maze 2
Finished after 275 iterations, 11.682528 ms total, 0.04248192 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

It looks like the number of iterations was basically cut in half. This makes sense;
if you look up your grandparents label, information can propagate at a rate of
two pixels per iteration as opposed to one. This should halve the number
of iterations.

# Part 3

# TODO: Recheck part 3 on the GPU, add discussion

## Maze 1
Finished after 8 iterations, 14.272517 ms total, 1.784064625 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions


## Maze 2
Finished after 8 iterations, 4.974752 ms total, 0.621844 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

# Part 4

## Maze 1
Finished after 8 iterations, 8.779498 ms total, 1.09743725 ms per iteration
Found 2 regions

## Maze 2
Finished after 8 iterations, 5.449567 ms total, 0.681195875 ms per iteration

There didn't seem to be much of a difference on my CPU. #TODO Figure out why this works...and if it will help.

# Part 5

It still definitely works. It takes a couple more iterations, as the labels can increase and can be
overwritten while updating, but it converges to the correct answer. For example,

## Maze 1
Finished after 10 iterations, 1.089216 ms total, 0.1089216 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions

## Maze 2
Finished after 9 iterations, 5.204919 ms total, 0.578324333333 ms per iteration
Found 35 regions
