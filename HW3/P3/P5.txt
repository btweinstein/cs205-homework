configuration ('blocked', 128, 4): 0.005328328 seconds

The time here was basically independent of the number of workgroups;
the key value was the number of workers; 4 was the magic number.
As long as there were 4 workers, the code went very fast, i.e. plus
or minus 0.001 from the fastest time. Otherwise, the code was
about 10 times slower.
