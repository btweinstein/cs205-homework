A) We do see some behavior that I would naively expect. We initiate
a pool of four processes and naively expect that the jobs
1-10 should complete in order. Instead what we see is something like:

Hi Job 0
Hi Job 2
Hi Job 3
Hi Job 1
Bye Job 0
Hi Job 4
Bye Job 3
Bye Job 2

Somehow, Job 2 is launched before job 3 *and* job 1! Then, even though
job 2 was launched before job 3, it finishes after job 3; I would not
expect this. Evidently it is not possible to control precisely when
each thread executes and finishes!

The inability to control exactly when threads execute and finish has
large implications for parallel computing.
