Note that my code for the BFS is in the "network_commands" module in the directory above. I wanted to put all of my
network code in the same place (and multiple problems deal with networks).

My graph is represented by (superhero, [superheroes linked to]). I guess it could be thought of as
(A, [B, C, D...]). It is symmetric (as desired!).

Well, if the maximum diameter is 10, the BFS must be finished by step 10. This can be thought
of the maximum number of steps someone walking between nodes can take to span the graph.

>>What does it mean if a character does not have a defined distance during the search?

It means that they were not touched during the updates; they are not connected to the
original node. 

### Results ###

* Captain America is connected to 6407 other characters within 10 iterations.
* Miss Thing/Mary is connected to 6 other characters within 10 iterations.
* Orwell is connected to 8 other characters within 10 iterations.
