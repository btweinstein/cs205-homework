###### Shortest path #######

The shortest path between 'Harvard_University' and 'Kevin_Bacon' is of length 3.
One example is

[u'Harvard_University', u'Tommy_Lee_Jones', u'JFK_(film)', u'Kevin_Bacon']

There are a ton of choices to use for the path, of course.

For fun, I found the shortest path between 'Bob_Saget' and 'Satan'. There is a
surprisingly short distance of 3 between the two. One such path is

[u'Bob_Saget',
 u'Musical_theatre',
 u'South_Park:_Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut',
 u'Satan']

which makes intuitive sense to me.

##### Connected Components #####

### Directed Graph ###

When we have a directed graph, my algorithm finds that we have 52
connected components. It converges in a logarithmic manner, specifically:


Beginning of Iteration 1
Before update: 3773865 groups
Beginning of Iteration 2
Before update: 931367 groups
Beginning of Iteration 3
Before update: 141195 groups
Beginning of Iteration 4
Before update: 10466 groups
Beginning of Iteration 5
Before update: 1107 groups
Beginning of Iteration 6
Before update: 177 groups
Beginning of Iteration 7
Before update: 71 groups
Beginning of Iteration 8
Before update: 60 groups
Beginning of Iteration 9
Before update: 56 groups
Beginning of Iteration 10
Before update: 53 groups
Finished at end of iteration 10 !
There are  53  groups in the network.

See the plot "directed_graph_components_vs_iteration.png" to see the logarithmic convergence of my algorithm.

### Undirected Graph ###

We get a result that makes truly no sense; there are more unconnected components
than in the directed case. I must have messed up somewhere...
